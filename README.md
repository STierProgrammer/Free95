# Free95
Free95 is an open-source windows-compatible operating system.

# Status
We are currently forking a pre-existing kernel called "Uinxed" (https://github.com/ViudiraTech/Uinxed-Kernel) and we will implement our current existing NT Executive Layer Implementation to the fork as the kernel is stable and has many features, we have decided it is better than building our own kernel from the ground up.

# Gallery
## 0.3.0 Beta 2

# What it is
Free95 is your friendly Windows Environment with an added trust of the open source community, all your favorite games, applications and such from Windows will run perfectly fine on Free95 aswell!

-- FREE95 IS NOT A RECREATION OR A CLONE OF THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT KERNEL. IT SIMPLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS APPLICATIONS BY IMPLEMENTING THE NT EXECUTIVE LAYER TO APPLICATIONS. IT IS A KERNEL OF IT'S OWN :)

# What it is NOT
- An NT Clone
- A Windows 95 Clone (NT 4.0! Not 95, althought NT 4 is the NT version of 95.)

# Why?
To remove Windows's bloat, and security problems. Being controlled by a large corporation is unsettling.
