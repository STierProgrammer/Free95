# What it is
**[Free95](https://versoft-software.github.io/)** combines the familiar Windows environment with the reliability and transparency of open-source software. It aims to provide full compatibility with Windows applications, ensuring your favorite games and programs run seamlessly.

>[!NOTE]
> Free95 is NOT a recreation or clone of the Microsoft Windows NT kernel. It provides Windows application support by implementing its own NT executive layer. Free95 features a custom-built kernel, independent of Windows NT.

# What it is NOT
- An NT Clone
- A Windows 95 Clone (NT 4.0! Not 95, althought NT 4 is the NT version of 95.)

# Project Purpose
The primary goal of Free95 is to eliminate Windows' bloatware and privacy concerns. Dependence on a large corporation for an operating system is unsettling. Our mission is to develop a fully open-source OS that maintains **full compatibility with Microsoft Windows applications**. Free95 achieves this through its **custom kernel and built-in NT executive layer**, ensuring smooth execution of Windows programs.
