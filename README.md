# What it is
**[Free95](https://versoft-software.github.io/)** operating systemy combines your friendly Windows Environment with an added trust of the open source community. All your favorite games, applications and such from Windows will run perfectly fine on Free95 aswell!

>[!NOTE]
> FREE95 IS NOT A RECREATION OR A CLONE OF THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT KERNEL. IT SIMPLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS APPLICATIONS BY IMPLEMENTING THE NT EXECUTIVE LAYER TO APPLICATIONS. IT IS A KERNEL OF IT'S OWN :)

# What it is NOT
- An NT Clone
- A Windows 95 Clone (NT 4.0! Not 95, althought NT 4 is the NT version of 95.)

# Why?
To remove Windows's bloat, and security problems. Being controlled by a large corporation is unsettling.

# How can i join this project?
You can join this project by simply doing so, literally. Just create a pull request, unless you have discord, in which case you can DM dripkap_19416 to join and communicate with other developers of the project.

# Running releases
You can either compile the Operating System from source, (running ``` make ``` in free95/) or downloading a binary from the Releases section.
